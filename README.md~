# Minimum Edit Distance
## Overview
Originally used levenshtein distance to calculate the minimum edit distance between words. Later shifted the cost for different changes in the words, which increased accuracy with possible overfitting. Effectively creates a spell check for dict.txt with 82% accuracy.
For more information on minimum edit distance, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance]
